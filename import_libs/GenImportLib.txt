This document describes how to build import libraries for other compilers.

LIBZPLAY.DLL exports functions using _stdcall calling convention and undecoreted names, without @nn at the end of function name and
without _ at the beginning of funtion name.

======================================
1. Building import library for MinGW
======================================

Build libzplay.dll using MSVC++ without def file and without LIB_ZPLAY_EXPORT_WITH_DEF_FILE directive, only with LIB_ZPLAY_DYNAMIC directive.
This will export stdcall functions with decorated names, you need this for MinGW. Then use pexports on this dll and generate def
file:

pexports -o libzplay.dll > mingw.def

Edit mingw.def file and remove _ from beginning of all exported functions.

_CreateZPlay@0  must be CreateZPlay@0
_zplay_StereoCut@16 must be zplay_StereoCut@16

You need also correct ordinal numbers to match original libzplay.dll. This is necessarily when you make
new version of dll with new functions added.

Build original libzplay.dll.

Then use dlltool to produce MinGW import library:

dlltool -D libzplay.dll -l libzplay.a -d mingw.def -k

This will produce MinGW import library for linking MinGW applications with libzplay.dll

=====================================
2. Building original libzplay.dll
=====================================

To build original libzplay.dll with undecorated function names we need to do export functions using def file.
Use libzplay.dll from above, created without def file and without LIB_ZPLAY_EXPORT_WITH_DEF_FILE, and generate def file
with pexports:

pexports -o libzplay.dll > libzplay.def

Edit libzplay.def file and remove all _ from beginning of function names and remove all @nn at function ends.

_CreateZPlay@0 must be CreateZPlay	
_zplay_StereoCut@16 must be zplay_StereoCut

...

Then build original libzplay.dll file using this libzplay.def and specifiying LIB_ZPLAY_EXPORT_WITH_DEF_FILE and LIB_ZPLAY_DYNAMIC.

This will produce libzplay.dll, exporting undecorated function names.

=======================================
3. Building import library for Borland
=======================================

Use implib on original libzplay.dll to generete import library:

implib libzplay.lib libzplay.dll

======================================
4. Build import library for Visual C++
======================================

Create def file with original libzplay.dll:

pexports -o libzplay.dll libzplay.def

Create import library:

lib /machine:i386 /def:libzplay.def
