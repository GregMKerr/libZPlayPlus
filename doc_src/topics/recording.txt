Summary:
Recording with libZPlay library.

Description:
First, you can <LINK SELECT_INPUT_DEVICE, select input device (soundcard)>.
If you have only one soundcard you can skip this because you have no choice.
You will use default soundcard.



Then you need to <LINK OPEN_SOURCE_LINE, open source line>.
You can choose recording line from recording mixer (Line-in, Microphone, CD Audio, ...).
Or you can leave current settings. 

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt><COLOR RED>On Windows Vista and Windows 7 you can't select source line using libZPlay library.
Use mixer window to select source line by yourself.</COLOR>
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>

After you open source line, <LINK SELECT_OUTPUT_FILE, select output file and encoding format>.
If you don't select output file, recording samples will be sent to soundcard output.
If you select output file, samples will be encoded and saved into specified disk file.

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>Each opening function will cancel output to file and set output to soundcard.
So, if you need oputput to disk file, you must select output file after you <LINK OPEN_SOURCE_LINE, open source line>.
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>

And now we are ready to record some samples to disk file.
All you need to do is to <LINK RECORDING_CONTROLS, start playing (recording)>.


Library will take samples from <LINK SELECT_INPUT_DEVICE, select input device (soundcard)> using <LINK OPEN_SOURCE_LINE, open source line>
and encode/save these samples into <LINK SELECT_OUTPUT_FILE, select output file>.
When you stop playing/recording, output file will be closed and you can use this new created file.


<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>Stop function will close output file. If you start recording again using existing output file,
you will overwrite existing file.
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>
