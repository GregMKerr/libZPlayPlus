Summary:
<i>Sample accurate</i> detection of song length.

Description:
Accuracy of song lentgh detection depends on <LINK SupportedFormats, stream format>.

If you need sample accurate song length detection, user must enable this setting.

<b>This setting is disabled by default. Any new created interface will have this setting disabled.</b>

If this setting is disabled, song length isn't <i>sample accurate</i>, it's pretty accurate, but not <i>sample accurate</i>.
By enabling this setting, you will get <i>sample accurate</i> song length.

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>To acquire sample accurate length on <LINK FormatMp3, MP3 stream>, decoder must scan whole stream and count all mp3 frames.
And <LINK LAMETAG, LAME INFO tag> must be present to detect encoder delay and padding samples.
IF LAME INFO tag isn't present, you can't get sample accurate length of mp3 stream.
See <LINK FormatMp3, MP3 decoder details>.
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>
