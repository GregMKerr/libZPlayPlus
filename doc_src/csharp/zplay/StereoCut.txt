Summary:
  Cut center or sides from stereo.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - True enables stereo cut, false disables stereo cut.
  %PAR1% - True outputs center and cuts sides. False outputs sides and cut center.
  %PAR2% - True enables bass to sides, false disables bass to sides.

Return Value List:
  True: All OK.
  False: Error. To get error message read <LINK GET_ERROR_MESSAGE, here>.

Remarks:
Using this function you can cut center or side from stereo sound. This algorithm is based on FFT algorithm.

<IMAGE note> Note: Set <c>%PAR2%</c> to true to enable bass output to sides. In this case bass from stereo center will not be cut and will remain in output.

If you cut sides from stereo sound, resulting sound will contain only stereo center.
In this case you will get sound with vocal, but without music.

If you cut sides from stereo sound, resulting sound will contain only stereo center.
In this case you will get sound with vocal, but without music.
