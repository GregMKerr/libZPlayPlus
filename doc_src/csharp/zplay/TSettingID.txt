Summary:
  Interface setting identifier.

Parameters:
sidWaveBufferSize - Change wave buffer size in milliseconds.
                    <p>Class will always try to have enough data decoded and ready to play.
                    <p><IMAGE note> Note: Minimal size of wave buffer is 100 milliseconds. But this value <b>can be 0</b>.
                    If you set wave buffer size to 0, library will not open wave output and there will be no playing.
                    But you can use callback message to retrieve decoded audio data and play this data by yourself, or save this data into file.
                    If you don't need to play data to soundcard, set wave buffer size to 0.
                    <p><p>If this value is too small, there can be problem with playing if your processor can't provide enough decoded data all the time.
                    <p>If this value is too large, you will notice delay when you apply (enable, disable) sound effects (equalizer, echo, pitch ...).
sidAccurateLength - Sample accurate stream length.
	            <p>Set this setting to 1 to enable "sample" accurate song length calculation.
	            If this setting is 0, there is no guaranty that song length is <i>sample accurate</i>. 
sidAccurateSeek   - Sample accurate seek.
                    <p>Set this setting to 1 to enable <i>sample accurate</i> seek.
	            <p>If this setting is 0, there is no guaranty that seek is <i>sample accurate</i>. 
sidSamplerate     - Samplerate for <LINK FormatPCM, PCM format>.
sidChannelNumber  - Number of channels for <LINK FormatPCM, PCM format>. Valid values are 1 or 2.
sidBitPerSample   - Bit per sample for <LINK FormatPCM, PCM format>. Valid values are 8 or 16.
sidBigEndian      - Big-endian or little-endian for <LINK FormatPCM, PCM format>. 1 is big-endian (Motorola), 0 is little-endian (Intel).

Remarks:
Use this value to specify which setting parameter you need to set or get.
