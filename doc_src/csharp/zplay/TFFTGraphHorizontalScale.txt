Summary:
FFT graph horizontal frequency scale.

Parameters:
gsLogarithmic - Logarithmic frequency distribution.
gsLinear      - Linear frequency distribution.


Remarks:
Frequency distribution on graph X - axis can be linear or logarithmic.

Logarithimc distribution shows more of lower frequencies and less of high frequencies.

Linear distribution shows all frequencies equally.
