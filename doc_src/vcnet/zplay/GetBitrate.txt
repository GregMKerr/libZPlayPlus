Summary:
  Get current bitrate.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - If this value is true, average bitrate is returned. If this value is false, real bitrate is returned.

Returns:
Bitrate in kbps (kilo bit per second).

Remarks:
On CBR (constant bitrate) streams this value is constant all the time.
On VBR (variable bitrate) this value represents bitrate of currently decoded data frame.

<IMAGE note> Note: If you need bitrate of whole file or stream, use <LINK libZPlayVC::ZPlay::GetStreamInfo, GetStreamInfo> function
and <LINK libZPlayVC::TStreamInfo, TStreamInfo.Bitrate>.
