Summary:
  Draw <LINK FFT_GRAPH, FFT graph> on window control using window handle.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - Handle to device context.
  %PAR1% - Specifies the logical x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the destination rectangle.
  %PAR2% - Specifies the logical y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the destination rectangle.
  %PAR3% - Specifies the logical width of the source and destination rectangles.
            <P><IMAGE caution> Caution: There is minimal width value. See <LINK libZPlayDelphi.TFFTGraphSize, TFFTGraphSize>.
  %PAR4% - Specifies the logical height of the source and the destination rectangles.
            <P><IMAGE caution> Caution: There is minimal height value. See <LINK libZPlayDelphi.TFFTGraphSize, TFFTGraphSize>.

Return Value List:
  True: All OK.
  False: Error. To get error message read <LINK GET_ERROR_MESSAGE, here>.


Remarks:
Function will use window handle to get device context of specified window and then draw graph on this device context.
Drawing data are fully synchronized with audio data from wave buffer.
All you need is to call this function when you need to refresh displayed graph data.
To get smooth animation effect, call this function 10 - 20 times per second.
You can create another thread to do this job.
<P><IMAGE note> Note: This function must perform FFT analysis on audio data and this takes some time if you set too big <LINK libZPlayDelphi.TFFTGraphParamID, gpFFTPoints> value.
If you set fast refresh interval, this can take too much proccessor time. Be careful.

Example:

<code lang="delphi">
procedure TForm1.fftgraphPaint(Sender: TObject);
begin
 player.DrawFFTGraphOnHDC(fftgraph.Canvas.Handle, 0, 0, fftgraph.Width, fftgraph.Height);
end;
