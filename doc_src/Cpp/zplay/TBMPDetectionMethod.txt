Summary:
Beat-per-minute detection method.

Parameters:
dmPeaks           - Detect BPM using peaks detection algorithm.
dmAutoCorrelation - Detect BPM using autocorrelation algorithm.

Remarks:
<b>dmPeaks</b> detection method is using FFT analysis to divide frequency range into subbands.
Each subband is analyzed to detect energy peaks and calculate beat.
When we have beat value detected in all subbands, most accurate value is selected as songs BPM.
This methos is faster, but less accurate.

<b>dmAutoCorrelation</b> detection method is using FFT analysis to divide frequency range into subbands.
Each subband is analyzed with autocorrelation to detect beat.
When we have beat value detected in all subbands, most accurate value is selected as songs BPM.
This method is slower, but more accurate.
