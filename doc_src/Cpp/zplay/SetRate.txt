Parameters:
  nRate - New rate value.
          Normal rate = 100, smaller values represent slower rate, larger value represents faster rates.

Remarks:
Rate value 100 indicates normal playing rate and sound is not changed at all.

To slow down playing, set rate to value smaller than 100.
This will slow down playback and output pitch will also be changed to lower values.

To speed up playing, set rate to value larger than 100.
This will speed up playback and output pitch will also be changed to higher values.
