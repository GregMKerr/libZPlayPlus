Summary:
  Enable or disable reverse mode.

Parameters:
  fEnable - Value 1 enables reverse mode, value 0 disables reverse mode and restore normal mode.

Return Value List:
  1: All OK.
  0: Error. To get error message read <LINK GET_ERROR_MESSAGE, here>.

Remarks:
By enabling reverse mode song will play backward. Backward playing algorithm is efficient.
There is no large memory allocation, no predecoding of whole file, no temporary disk file, ....
This is true backward playing, backward decoding.

<IMAGE note> Note: You can enable or disable reverse mode while song is playing. Just switch reverse mode on and off.

This function will not stop playing. If song is playing and you enters reverse mode, song will continue playing backward to 0 position.
Position indicator will also display real position.

<IMAGE note> Note: In reverse mode, position indicator displays real position, it goes backward.

<IMAGE note> Note: You can't play backward from 0 position. So, you need to seek away from song beginning and then play backward.

<IMAGE caution> Warning: You can't use this function on <LINK DYNAMIC_STREAM, dynamic stream>.
