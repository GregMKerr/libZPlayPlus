Summary:
Basic libZPlay interface based on ZPlay C++ class.

Description:
This interface is implemented as <LINK libZPlayCpp::ZPlay, ZPlay C++ abstract class> and related <LINK !!MEMBERTYPE_Methods_libZPlayCpp::ZPlay, methods>.

All you need to do is to create instance of ZPlay class.
Interaction with this class is implemented through <LINK !!MEMBERTYPE_Methods_libZPlayCpp::ZPlay, class methods>. 

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>ZPlay class is enclosed into <b>libZPlay</b> namespace.
Include this namespace into your project to access ZPlay C++ class interface.
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>

* How to use C++ interface *
- include <LINK !!libZPlayCPP, libZPlay.h> into your project
- include <b>libZplay</b> namespace
- create instance of ZPlay class
- use <LINK !!MEMBERTYPE_Methods_libZPlayCpp::ZPlay, ZPlay methods> to play music
- link your project with dll interface library

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>You must link your project with dll interface library to access exported functions from libzplay.dll.
* Visual C++ - link with libzplay.lib
* Borland C++ - link with libzplay_borland.lib
* GNU C++ , MinGW - link with libzplay.a

<IMAGE star_green>To create class instance, user must use class factory function <LINK libZPlayCpp::CreateZPlay, CreateZPlay()>.
<code lang="c++">
#include "libzplay.h"

// use libZPlay namespace
using namespace libZPlay;

// create class instance using class factory function
ZPlay *instance = CreateZPlay();
</code> 


<IMAGE star_red><b>Note: </b>User <b><COLOR RED>can't create</COLOR></b> instance of ZPlay class using <b>new</b> keyword:
<code lang="c++">
#include "libzplay.h"

// use namespace for our class
using namespace libZPlay;

// create class instance using new keyword
ZPlay *instance = new ZPlay;	// this will fail !!!
// 'ZPlay' : cannot instantiate abstract class due to following members
</code>



When class instance is created, use <LINK !!MEMBERTYPE_Methods_libZPlayCpp::ZPlay, ZPlay methods> to play your songs.

Remarks:
At the end, class instance must be destroyed with <LINK libZPlayCpp::ZPlay::Release, Release> method:
<code lang="c++">
// destroy class instance
instance->Release();
</code>
