Summary:
  Change pitch without changing tempo.

Parameters:
  nPitch - New pitch value.
           Normal pitch = 100, smaller values represent lower pitch, larger values represent higher pitch.
           <p><IMAGE note> Note: This value can't be 0.


Return Value List:
  1: All OK.
  0: Error. To get error message read <LINK GET_ERROR_MESSAGE, here>.

Remarks:
Pitch value 100 indicates normal pitch and sound is not changed at all.

To lower pitch, set pitch to value smaller than 100.
This will lower pitch without changing tempo.
But this value can't be 0 because you can't play something by not playing at all with pitch 0 :-)

To raise pitch, set pitch to value larger than 100.
This will raise pitch without changing tempo.
