Summary:
Attached picture from ID3/VORBIS tag. (UNICODE version). Only in version 2.00 and above.

Parameters:
PicturePresent  - Indicates if image is present in info tag. If this value is 1 image is present in info tag. In this case MIMEType, PictureType,
                  Description, PictureData and PictureDataSize are valid.
CanDrawPicture  - Indicates if image is decoded into hBitmap field. If this value is 1, image is decoded into hBitmap and hBitmap, Width and Height
                  members are valid. See Remarks section.
MIMEType        - MIME type and subtype for the image (e.g. image/jpeg).  Valid if PicturePresent is 1.
PictureType     - Picture type. Search on Goole for informations about id3v2 frames (APIC frame). Valid if PicturePresent is 1.
Description_    - User description for attached picture. Valid if PicturePresent is 1.
PictureData     - Pointer to raw picture data. This can be any image type. Use MIMEType to determine image type. Valid if PicturePresent is 1.
PictureDataSize - Size, in bytes, of raw picture data. Valid if PicturePresent is 1.
hBitmap         - HBITMAP handle of decoded picture. Available only if CanDrawPicture is returned 1. See Remarks for more info.
Width           - Picture width in pixels. Available only if image is decoded into hBitmap and CanDrawPicture is set to 1.
Height          - Picture height in pixels. Available only if image is decoded into hBitmap and CanDrawPicture is set to 1.
reserved        - reserved for future use.

Remarks:
If there is valid picture attached into ID3v2 or VORBIS COMMENT tag, PicturePresent will be set to 1.
If PicturePresent member is set to 1, use MIMEType to determine image type, use Description member to get picture description, use
PictureData and PictureDataSize members to access raw image data.

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>PictureData member points to raw image data. Raw image data is actually file format data. For example:
if MIME type is image/jpeg, you can save PictureData bytes directly into file with jpg extension and you will get valid jpg file.
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>


User can request to decode attached image into bitmap format. libZPlay supports internal jpeg and png decoders. If CanDrawPicture is set to 1,
hBitmap member is valid HBITMAP handle.
Use this handle to draw picture on screen with <LINK libZPlayCpp::ZPlay::DrawBitmapToHDC, DrawBitmapToHDC> or
<LINK libZPlayCpp::ZPlay::DrawBitmapToHWND, DrawBitmapToHWND>.

If attached image format is not supported by internal image decoder, use PictureData and PictureDataSize members to acces raw image data and use your own decoder
to decode and draw image. For example: if attached image is GIF type (not supported internally by library),
you need to take PictureData and use your own GIF decoder to decode this image into
bitmap format and draw on screen.
