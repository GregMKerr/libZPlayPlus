Summary:
C Style interface for libZPlay library.

Description:
This interface is wrapper around <LINK !!MEMBERTYPE_Methods_libZPlayCpp::ZPlay, ZPlay methods>.

Each method is implemented as single C style function using <b>__stdcall</b> calling convention.
 

All you need to do is to create instance of ZPlay class, but using C style function.
Class instance will be created internally, and user will use this instance as some sort of handle.
With this handle, user can access ZPlay methods using wrapper functions.

* How to use C Style interface *
- include <LINK !!libZPlayCPP, libZPlay.h> into your project
- include <b>libZplay</b> namespace
- create instance/handle of ZPlay class using <LINK libZPlayCpp::zplay_CreateZPlay, zplay_CreateZPlay()> function.
- use <LINK !!FUNCTIONS_libZPlayCpp, C Style Interface functions> to play music
- link your project with dll interface library

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>You must link your project with dll interface library to access exported functions from libzplay.dll.
* Visual C++ - link with libzplay.lib
* Borland C++ - link with libzplay_borland.lib
* GNU C++ , MinGW - link with libzplay.a

<IMAGE star_green>To create new class instance use <LINK libZPlayCpp::zplay_CreateZPlay, zplay_CreateZPlay()> function:
<code lang="c++">
#include "libzplay.h"

// use namespace for interface
using namespace libZPlay;

// create class instance using C Style class factory function
ZPLAY_HANDLE instance = zplay_CreateZPlay();
</code> 

<INCLUDE extensions\\note_start.txt>There is no difference between class instance created by <LINK libZPlayCpp::CreateZPlay, CreateZPlay()> function and <LINK libZPlayCpp::zplay_CreateZPlay, zplay_CreateZPlay()> function.
<INCLUDE extensions\\note_end.txt>

When ZPLAY_HANDLE (class instance) is created, use <LINK !!FUNCTIONS_libZPlayCpp, C Style Interface functions> to play your songs.


Remarks:
At the end, ZPLAY_HANDLE (class instance) must be destroyed with <LINK libZPlayCpp::zplay_DestroyZPlay , zplay_DestroyZPlay > function:
<code lang="c++">
// destroy class instance, in this case C Style interface
zplay_DestroyZPlay(instance);
</code>
