Summary:
Push new data to <LINK DYNAMIC_STREAM, dynamic stream>.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - Reference to a memory block with stream data.
  %PAR1% - Size of memory block, in bytes. If this value is 0, <i>end marker</i> is added to stream.

Return Value List:
  True: All OK.
  False: Error. To get error message read <LINK GET_ERROR_MESSAGE, here>.

Remarks:
This function only works on <LINK DYNAMIC_STREAM, dynamic stream>.
If you try to push data into static stream, this function will fail.

If stream is <b>buffered stream</b>, this function makes copy of input data into internal buffer.
Interface instance is responsible for this internal data and user can destroy original source buffer pointed by <c>%PAR0%</c>.

If stream is <b>not buffered</b>, function takes only pointer to input data and user is responsible for data
pointed by <c>%PAR0%</c> pointer.

If <c>%PAR0%</c> is 0, <i>end marker</i> is added to stream.
This indicates that there will be no more data for stream.
If you add <i>end marker</i> to stream, when stream runs out of data, playing will be stopped and stream will not wait for new data.
If there is no <i>end marker</i> added to stream, when stream runs out of data, playing is paused and stream is waiting for new data.
