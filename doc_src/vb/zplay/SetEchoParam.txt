Summary:
Set and change echo effect parameters.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - Reference to array of <see cref="TEchoEffect"/> structures specifying echo effects.
  %PAR1% - Number of echo effects in <c>%PAR0%</c> array.

Return Value List:
  True: All OK.
  False: Error. To get error message read <LINK GET_ERROR_MESSAGE, here>.

Remarks:
To produce echo effect, original samples are combined with delayed samples.
You need to specify delay (in milliseconds) and volume of original samples and delayed samples.

To specify one echo effect, fill <LINK libZPlayVB.TEchoEffect, TEchoEffect>  with valid data.
To specify multiple, complex echo effects, specify array of <LINK libZPlayVB.TEchoEffect, TEchoEffects>.
Output sound is combination of original samples and delayed samples.

<IMAGE note> Note: If you specify multiple delay effects, make note about volume because all effects will combine original
samples with delayed samples for each effect and you will have summary of all samples.

For example: first effect is using 60 % volume of original(not delayed) samples and on these samples are added 20 % volume delayed samples.
Second effect is  using 0 % volume of original samples and  20 % volume of delayed samples.
And resulting samples from first effect are added to resulting samples from second effect.
If you use too much percent of volume, you can get overflow of sample amplitude and sound distorsions.


<IMAGE note> Note: There is no limit on number of echo effects.

<IMAGE note> Note: By default, new created interface has programmed one simple echo effect, 1000 ms delay, 70 % original volume + 30 % echo volume.
