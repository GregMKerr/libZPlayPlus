Summary:
  Detect beat-per-minute value of specified file.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - String specifying file name.
  %PAR1% - Stream <LINK libZPlayVB.TStreamFormat, format identifier>. Use <b>sfAutodetect</b> if you need to autodetect stream format of specified file.
  %PAR2% - Detection method. See valid <LINK libZPlayVB.TBPMDetectionMethod, detection methods>.

Returns:
BPM value. If algorithm can't detect BPM value, return value is 0.


Remarks:
This function will open temporary stream and detect beat-per-minute. When detection process is done, stream will be closed.

<IMAGE note> Note: Detection process can take some time.

<IMAGE note> Warning: This function <b>WILL NOT</b> interfere with current playing.

BPM detection algorithm isn't 100 % accurate.
Algorithm will stop when first valid BPM value is detected.
If BPM value can't be detected, algorithm will try to search whole stream.
If this fails, returned BPM value is 0.
