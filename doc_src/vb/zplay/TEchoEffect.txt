Summary:
  Echo effect structure.

Parameters:
nLeftDelay	 - Delay of left channel in milliseconds.
nLeftSrcVolume   - Percent of original volume in output for left channel.
nLeftEchoVolume  - Percent of echo volume in output for left channel.
nRightDelay      - Delay of right channel in milliseconds.
nRightSrcVolume  - Percent of original volume in output for right channe.
nRightEchoVolume - Percent of echo volume in output for right channel.

Remarks:
This structure specifies one echo effect. Hot it works:

You can combine original samples with delayed samples.
Original samples are reduced to <b>nLeftSrcVolume</b>.
Delayed samples are reduced to <b>nLeftEchoVolume</b>.
And these samples are combined to output.

<IMAGE note> Note: Be careful with volume percents.
