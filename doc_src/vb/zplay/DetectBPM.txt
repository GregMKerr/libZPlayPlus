Summary:
  Detect beat-per-minute of current stream.

Parameters:
  %PAR0% - Detection method. See valid <LINK libZPlayVB.TBPMDetectionMethod, detection methods>.

Returns:
BPM value. If algorithm can't detect BPM value, return value is 0.


Remarks:
This function will scan current stream and detect beat-per-minute.

<IMAGE note> Note: Detection process can take some time.

<IMAGE caution> <b>Warning: THIS FUNCTION WILL STOP CURRENT PLAYING AND SET POSITION TO 0.</b>
<P>If you need to detect BPM value without interference with playig stream, use <LINK libZPlayVB.ZPlay.DetectFileBPM, DetectFileBPM> function.

BPM detection algorithm isn't 100 % accurate.
Algorithm will stop when first valid BPM value is detected.
If BPM value can't be detected, algorithm will try to search whole stream.
If this fails, returned BPM value is 0.

Example:

<code lang="vb.net">
If MessageBox.Show("This can take some time! Continue ?", "Detecting BPM", MessageBoxButtons.YesNoCancel) = System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.Yes Then
  Dim BPM As Integer = 0
  BPM = player.DetectBPM(TBPMDetectionMethod.dmPeaks)
  MessageBox.Show("BPM: " & System.Convert.ToString(BPM), "Detected BPM", MessageBoxButtons.OK)
End If
